# AirportTemps

This is a side-project i'm working on, analyzing long-term temperature trends from airport weather stations and visualizing the data on a map.

The goal is to download many years of daily temperature data at airports across the US, and fit a linear regression model to determine the long-term trends. 

I made a short blog post about the 1st iteration:
