<p>I love looking at weather data and have experimented in the past with some of the airport weather station data available from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com" class="uri">http://www.wunderground.com</a>. I saw this little analysis on R-bloggers <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/annual-mean-temperature-trends-12-airports/" class="uri">https://www.r-bloggers.com/annual-mean-temperature-trends-12-airports/</a> and thought it would be interesting to look at trends from stations across the US and visualize the results on a map.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setup, load packages
rm(list=ls())
library(weatherData)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
library(ggplot2)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(maps))
library(RColorBrewer)
library(magrittr)
library(leaflet)</code></pre>
<p>First we need a list of the weather stations we will use. Luckily the weatherData package already contains a compiled data frame ‘USAirportWeatherStations’ with all the stations and info about them. The ‘airportCode’ field is what will identify the station when we request the data through the wunderground API.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(USAirportWeatherStations)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##           Station State airportCode   Lat     Lon Elevation   WMO
## 1         Central    AK        PARL 65.57 -144.80       292 99999
## 2            Atka    AK        PAAK 52.22 -174.20        17 99999
## 3        Buckland    AK        PABL 65.99 -161.12         0 99999
## 4 Portage Glacier    AK        PATO 60.79 -148.83        29 99999
## 5        Nivalina    AK        PAVL 67.73 -164.55         3 70148
## 6         Golovin    AK        PAGL 64.55 -163.05         8 70199</code></pre>
<p>I want to fit a long-term trend, so i’ll get data starting in 1980 (a lot of the stations seem to go back this far).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Years we will get data for
year_list=1980:2016
st_list &lt;-USAirportWeatherStations$airportCode
# station KMMO 1993 doesn&#39;t work, skip
st_list &lt;- st_list[-which(st_list==&quot;KMMO&quot;)]</code></pre>
<p>Let’s first plot all the station locations. For this analysis, I’ll just use those in the continental/lower 48 US states. Including others like Alaska, Hawaii, Virgin Islands etc. makes the map very large and difficult to see. The leaflet pacakge makes a nice interactive map (try zooming and clicking on locations!).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># just plot all station locations
cont_us &lt;- USAirportWeatherStations %&gt;%
        filter(State!=&quot;AK&quot; &amp; State!=&quot;MP&quot; &amp; State!=&quot;PR&quot; &amp; State!=&quot;HI&quot; &amp; State!=&quot;VI&quot; &amp; State!=&quot;GU&quot;)

m &lt;- leaflet() %&gt;%
        setMaxBounds(-125,23,-67,50)%&gt;%
        addTiles() %&gt;%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
        addCircleMarkers(lng=cont_us$Lon,lat=cont_us$Lat,popup=cont_us$Station,radius=2,fill=TRUE,color=&quot;grey&quot;)
m  # Print the map</code></pre>

<p>The next bit of code downloads the data from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com" class="uri">http://www.wunderground.com</a>. This is the most time-consuming part of the analysis. It appears that the wunderground API only lets you download a year of data at a time. With my laptop and wifi speed, I estimate it takes about 2-3 sec to download each 1 year data file. For 36 years of data (1980-2016) at about 1600 stations, that works out to about 48 hours! Luckily it is easy to write a loop to do this, and I just let it run overnight or in the background until it was done.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Define function to download daily weather for 1 year.
# I had trouble getting the functions in the weatherData package to work, but once we have the formula for the API it is easy to grab the data.

get_yearly_weather &lt;- function (year,st_code){
        url &lt;- paste0(&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/&quot;,st_code,&quot;/&quot;,year,&quot;/1/1/CustomHistory.html?dayend=31&amp;monthend=12&amp;yearend=&quot;,year,&quot;&amp;req_city=NA&amp;req_state=NA&amp;req_statename=NA&amp;format=1&quot;)
}

# Define a function to download the weather data for a given station code for each year
get_all_years &lt;- function(st_code){
        for (i in seq_along(year_list)) {
                year &lt;- year_list[i]
                savefile&lt;-file.path(&quot;~/AirportTemps/Data&quot;,paste0(&quot;wea&quot;,st_code,year,&quot;.csv&quot;))
                if (file.exists(savefile)){
                        print(paste(savefile,&quot; already downloaded&quot;))
                }else{
                        url=get_yearly_weather(year,st_code)
                        print(paste(&quot;Getting weather data for &quot;,st_code,&quot; for year &quot;,year))
                        download.file(url,savefile)
                }
        }
}

# Apply that function to station list to get data for all stations
tryapply(st_list, get_all_years)</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we finally have all the yearly data files downloaded. Now i’ll combine the yearly files (1980-2015) for each station into a single combined file. I also do some cleaning and remove bad temperature values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Remove bad temperature values (marked as -99999 in data)

        dat&lt;-subset(dat,Mean.TemperatureF&gt;-50);
        dat&lt;-subset(dat,Mean.TemperatureF&lt;150);
        dat

        # Load csv files for each year and combine into a single data frame
        year_list=1980:2015
        dat_all=data.frame()
        for (i in seq_along(year_list)) {
                year &lt;- year_list[i]
                #print(year)
                dat &lt;- read.csv( file.path( &quot;~/AirportTemps/Data&quot;,paste0(&quot;wea&quot;,st_code,year,&quot;.csv&quot;)))
                dat&lt;-rm_bad_wea_values(dat)
                dat$dd &lt;- ymd(dat[,1])
                dat_all=rbind(dat_all,dat)
        }
        # Check to make sure we have data (some files are empty)
        if (nrow(dat_all)&gt;(20*365)){
                # Save csv with combined data...
                write.csv(dat_all,savefile)
        }else{
                print(paste(&quot;station &quot;,st_code,&quot; doesn&#39;t have data&quot;))
        }
}

# some stations don&#39;t work, so need tryapply()
tryapply(st_list, combine_years_wea)</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we now have a single file for each station with all the data. I loop through and fit a linear trend vs time for each one, and store all the results in a dataframe. I’ll save the trend (coefficent) from the fit, and the p-values to evaluate how reliable the fit was.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(broom)

        if (file.exists(fname)){
                print(paste(&quot;Fitting to &quot;,st_list[i]))

                temp_fits&lt;-rbind(temp_fits,data_frame(airportCode=st_list[i],trend=fit_tidy$estimate[2],pval=fit_tidy$p.value[2]))
        }else{
                print(paste(&quot;combined file for station &quot;, st_list[i], &quot; doesn&#39;t exist, skipping&quot;))
        }
}

# save a csv file with the fit results
write.csv(temp_fits,file.path( &quot;~/AirportTemps/Data&quot;,&quot;temp_fits.csv&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the results. First i’ll define a little function to simplify loading the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># function to load combined 1980-2016 csv file for specified station
load_combined&lt;-function(st_code){
        fname&lt;-file.path( &quot;~/AirportTemps/Data&quot;,paste0(&quot;wea&quot;,st_code,&quot;combined.csv&quot;))
        dat&lt;- read.csv(fname)
        dat$dd &lt;- ymd(dat$dd)
        dat
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>temp_fits &lt;- read.csv(file.path( &quot;~/AirportTemps/Data&quot;,&quot;temp_fits.csv&quot;))

# convert trend to deg/decade
temp_fits$trend &lt;- temp_fits$trend*365*10</code></pre>
<p>How many fits have significant/non sig. p-values?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ig&lt;-which(temp_fits$pval&lt;0.05)
ib&lt;-which(temp_fits$pval&gt;0.05)
print(paste(length(ig),&quot; fits have p-values that are significant(&lt;0.05)&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;674  fits have p-values that are significant(&lt;0.05)&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(paste(length(ib),&quot; fits have p-values that are not significant(&gt;0.05)&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;350  fits have p-values that are not significant(&gt;0.05)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Look at the distribution of trends.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>boxplot(temp_fits$trend[ig],main=&quot;Temperature trends&quot;,ylab= &quot;deg/decade&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="AirportTemps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Most of the trends seem reasonable (magnitudes of about 2 degrees per decade), but there a few outliers. Lets look at those and see what’s going on.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iout &lt;- which(abs(temp_fits$trend)&gt;5)
temp_fits[iout,]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   X airportCode     trend          pval
## 5 5        PASH -9.528885 6.728656e-252</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>datout &lt;- load_combined(temp_fits$airportCode[iout])
g&lt;-ggplot(datout,aes(x=dd,y=Mean.TemperatureF))+geom_line()+geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;)
g</code></pre>
<p><img src="AirportTemps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>It’s obvious from the plot that something is wrong with the data for this station; there is a huge offset after the first ~5 years. Maybe the station was moved, or mislabeled? We’ll remove this station (note it is in Alaska, so I wouldn’t have plotted it in the end anyways).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>temp_fits &lt;- temp_fits[-iout,]</code></pre>
<p>Look at the distribution of trends again with the big outlier removed:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>boxplot(temp_fits$trend[ig],main=&quot;Temperature trends&quot;,ylab= &quot;deg/decade&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="AirportTemps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Let’s look at a good fit also, to convince ourselves we are doing this right:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>id &lt;- ig[550]
temp_fits[id,]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       X airportCode     trend         pval
## 851 851        KCLL 0.8246019 7.447468e-12</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>datgood &lt;- load_combined(temp_fits$airportCode[id])
g&lt;-ggplot(datgood,aes(x=dd,y=Mean.TemperatureF))+geom_line()+geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;)
g</code></pre>
<p><img src="AirportTemps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Ok this looks better. Note I haven’t removed any of the obvious seasonal cycle. My reasoning is that i’m interested in the long-term trend, and if there is a constant seasonal cycle it should average itself out (ie if the only variability in temperature was a seasonal cycle, the fit should give a trend of zero). In the future I plan to try fits over different time periods, and also with the seasonal cycle removed, to see how that affects the results.</p>
<p>Ok, now it’s time to make the awesome map i’ve been envisioning. First i’ll join the fit results with the station info so we have the locations and data together.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Only keep stations with significant p-values
temp_fits_good &lt;- temp_fits %&gt;%
        filter(pval&lt;0.05)

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>The map suggests the following conclusions, though more detailed analysis is needed to confirm them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of the stations show a warming trend</li>
<li>Some stations show a cooling trend.</li>
<li>Qualitatively from the map, it looks like the south/south east is warming at almost all stations.</li>
</ul>
